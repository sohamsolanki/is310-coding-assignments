### Assignment 1: Inspecting the Cultural Web
#### Library of Congress: Food and Foodways Web Archive
*https://www.loc.gov/collections/food-and-foodways-web-archive/*
- Was not able to find the GitHub repository, likely because it's a government website.
- It uses HTML, CSS, and JS technologies to display collection items.
- There are no files I do not recognize - it uses SVG and PNG files for icons and images, and uses a lot of JavaScript.
- The Library of Congress made this website, it is unknown how many people were involved in making it or curating the collection. The data is taken from publicaly available websites.
